# AKAN NAMING SYSTEM

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Akan naming system is a project which enables uses know their Akan names (names according to the day of the week when someone was born). This naming style is adapted from the Ghanaian culture of naming where children born, either male or female are given a name according to the name of the day of the week they are born. This system enables anyone not only Ghanaian to know which day of the week they were born after inputting their birthday date (i.e. date, month and year).

### Author
The system is developed by Sospeter Kung'u an aspriring programmer who has recently joined moringa school in April 2020, with the help from Technical Mentors at the institution.

### Setup Instructions
The system can be accessed by any web browser by users and for the developers who would want to access and modify the code, the following scripts file which contains all the scripts in the master folder should be run "js/scripts.js"

### Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
This is identifying what this program should do before determining how to make it do it. The program should prompt the user to enter their birthday and with this information, it calculates the day of the week when they were born. THe system first asks the user to input their birthday in the format DD/MM/YYYY as well as their gender. With this information gathered it uses the business logic to calculate the day of the week they were born. After this calculation, it attaches the day of the week as per the name given to that day by the Ghanaian culture, and alerts the user their birthday, day of the week as well as the specific Akan name according to the day of the week they were born.

### Technologies Used
This program is created using Atom, Git, Github and is viewable on any browser.
The formula to check the day of the week was obtained from stackoverflow
